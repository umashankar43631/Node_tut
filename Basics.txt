To Export the modules to other files, means if you want to use the current file/module variables/methods in another file then you need to export them


module.export.variablename = variable/method name

to import from some file you need to use require method of js

var logger = require('./filename')


if you want to export only single function we can directly give like this
module.export = method_name

var method_name = require('./filename')

method_name(params)

Every module/file in js in node places inside a wrapper function called module wrapper function

function (exports, require, module, __filename, __direname)

---------------------
__filename -- have the current file name and the path of it

__dirname - have the path of currently where this js file present, means parent folder path of the current file
